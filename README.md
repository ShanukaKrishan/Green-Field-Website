## Description

"The John Keellsâ€™ Supermarket chains along with the Department of Agriculture of Sri Lanka have decided to initiate a website for farmers all around Sri Lanka, to upload and notify about their harvest which then can be bought by the Keells staff. With the aim of providing the best produce to their customers straight from the farmers, this new approach benefits the farmers immensely as well for this is an easy approach in which they can reach out by which their produce can be sold. "



## Abstract

Farmers in Sri-Lanka always had a problem in selling their harvest to a supply chain with good commuincation. This is where Green field website shines. Now farmers can upload their harvest directly to the website along with the quantities and price and a supply chain can directly purchase from them. The supply chain can also rate the harvest from good to bad. All of the communication is maintained by the Department Of Agriculture of Sri-Lanka. DOA can approve farmers, rate their harvest and have a graph on best selling farmers. Theres also an in built chatting feature to help the supply chain and farmers communicate.
